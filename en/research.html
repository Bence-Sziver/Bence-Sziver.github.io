        <h2>
          <span>GOAL 1</span>: Enhancing drought tolerance through nanoparticle
          priming.
        </h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            <span>BACKGROUND</span> Given the prevailing challenges, our
            principal aim is to enhance the drought resilience of crops in
            accordance with the principles of sustainable agriculture. A
            promising green technology for achieving this is priming, which
            fortifies plants against stress by inducing defense processes.
            Nanoparticles possess advantageous physical and chemical properties
            that can be harnessed to enhance the efficiency of priming. The
            administration of nitric oxide (NO) and its derived reactive forms
            as chemical donors or in the form of plasma-activated liquids (PAL),
            along with smoke-derived karrikins (KAR), has been shown to have a
            stress-tolerance enhancing effect.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>
            <span>QUESTION</span> The main question in this practical,
            interdisciplinary work is whether the newly developed nano NO
            donors, nano KAR, and PAL stabilized with nanoparticles are more
            effective agents in enhancing drought tolerance during priming
            compared to their non-nano counterparts.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>
            <span>EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM</span> To answer this question, we conduct
            experiments in greenhouse model systems using a multi-level
            approach. We examine responses to drought at the cellular, organ,
            and organism levels and employ transcriptomics, proteomics, and
            metabolomics to characterize the stress-tolerance enhancing effects
            of nano materials.

          <span>GOAL 2</span>: Identification of Novel Nitrogen Monoxide-Linked
          Genes Associated with Osmotic Stress Response through Genetic
          Screening
        </h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            <span>BACKGROUND</span> Previously, a collection of 40,000
            transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines was generated, consisting of a
            cDNA library from a halophytic plant species, Lepidium crassifolium,
            known for its tolerance to salt, osmotic stress, and oxidative
            stress. These lines serve as the genetic screening material.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>
            <span>QUESTION</span> Can we screen for transgenic lines that
            exhibit altered responses to NO compared to the wild type, and
            thereby, can we identify new NO-linked genes playing a role in the
            osmotic stress response?
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>
            <span>EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM</span> We cultivate transgenic Arabidopsis
            thaliana plants in the presence of NO and observe their growth and
            developmental responses compared to the wild type. Promising
            candidates undergo detailed genetic and molecular biological
            investigations.

            <span>BACKGROUND</span> The project aims to support the research
            community by compiling scientific knowledge about plant NO on a

            user-friendly and easily accessible manner on a single platform.

          <span>GOAL 4</span>: Inducing plant fungal resistance by reactive nitrogen species liberating nanomaterials
        </h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            <span>BACKGROUND</span> Fungal pathogens are among the dominant causal agents of plant diseases that threaten food safety
            across the world. Plant defence against pathogens can be triggered by the eco-friendly priming
            approach during which an external stimulus is perceived by the plant as a warning signal that leads to
            a moderate activation of induced defence mechanisms resulting in a faster and/or stronger defence
            response upon subsequent pathogen attack. The gaseous signal molecule, nitric oxide (NO) and its
            reaction products (collectively reactive nitrogen species, RNS) have been proven to act as a broad
            defence initiator to potentiate plants' defence mechanisms.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>
            <span>EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM</span> The priming effect of these novel RNS liberating nanoagents will be studied in model plant-fungus
            pathosystems such as Arabidopsis thaliana-Alternaria brassicicola and Solanum lycopersicum-Botrytis
            cinerea.
